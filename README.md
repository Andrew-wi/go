# Go Game Engine, Andrew Winnicki

### Fri Dec 28
Initialized github repo, worked on basic classes and functions, sketched out basic abstractions of the game. Finished prototype for single player game; player can now place stones on the board according to the rules (can't have stones on top of one another). Must check for liberties next.

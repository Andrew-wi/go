# Go Game Engine, Andrew Winnicki

### Mon Jan 7
Still working on stones class in the engine. I can't figure out how to make a structure that has liberties (like a shape with two eyes and stuff) and how to make the computer see whether or not the shape is dead or alive algorithmically. I'll try again later.

### Fri Dec 28
Initialized github repo, worked on basic classes and functions, sketched out basic abstractions of the game. Finished prototype for single player game; player can now place stones on the board according to the rules (can't have stones on top of one another). Must check for liberties next.
